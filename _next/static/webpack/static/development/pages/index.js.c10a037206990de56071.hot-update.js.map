This helps strengthen the compounding effects of all our\n          projects as a whole. Open sourcing helps us reach this goal by\n          allowing us to collectively understand how all of our products can be\n          woven together on a technical level.\n        </p>\n      </CorePrinciple>\n      <CorePrinciple id=\"2\" title=\"Accessibility and Financial Inclusion\">\n        <p>\n          We strive to create a financial system that is accessible to anyone\n          with an internet connection. We believe in a world where value flows\n          freely, regardless of oneâ€™s geographic location.\n        </p>\n      </CorePrinciple>\n      <CorePrinciple id=\"3\" title=\"Financial Transparency\">\n        <p>\n          We believe that financial services should not be built in opaque\n          silos, but rather that market-level information should be transparent\n          to all participants while still preserving individual privacy.\n        </p>\n      </CorePrinciple>\n    </CorePrinciples>\n  </Section>\n);\n\nconst CorePrinciples = styled.div`\n  width: 773px;\n`;\n\nexport default styled(Description)``;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AA3BA;AACA;AAoCA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
